# Flutter Plugin Test

This is an experiment in creating a plugin infrastructure around the
Flutter demo app.

A plugin is a zip archive, which must contain at least a `metadata.json`
file with `id` and `name` fields, and a code compiled to `plugin.evc`.
See the `plugins` directory for examples and for a build script.
Open a plugin with the app to install it.
